# Kansei App

Notes summarizer and question generator for .md files.

Use the app at [Kansei](https://kanseii.vercel.app/)


- ### Motivation
    I use Obsidian to take notes and often while reviewing the notes, i have to go through a lot of text and points and therfore made this tool where i can upload the md files and it will parse the file and generate a summary and questions for each individual heading in the md file generated by obsidin. It works with any .md file but the general format should be headings with some text for ex:
    ```
    # Heading
     some text
    - some points
    - more points
    # Next heading 
     etc...
    ```
